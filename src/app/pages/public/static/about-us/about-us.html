                    1. Organizational Profile
                    The MyCoral Eco-Marine Project (MyCoral) is a premier sustainability initiative established under
                    the purview of the International Medical School (IMS) at Management and Science University (MSU).

                    Aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14: Life Below Water, the
                    organization serves as a bridge between academic research, environmental stewardship, and community
                    engagement. MyCoral operates with a dual mandate: to actively rehabilitate degraded coral reefs
                    through scientific intervention and to foster long-term climate resilience through education.

                    2. History & Background
                    MyCoral was founded in 2016 in response to the critical decline of marine biodiversity in the South
                    China Sea. Recognizing that environmental health is intrinsically linked to public health, MSU
                    expanded its academic scope to include planetary health.

                    The project initially focused on the waters off Setiu, Terengganu, specifically Pulau Geluk,
                    establishing it as a primary sanctuary for rehabilitation efforts. Over the past decade, the
                    initiative has evolved from annual student expeditions into a comprehensive, multi-stakeholder
                    program involving state government agencies, corporate partners, and international universities.

                    3. Strategic Pillars
                    MyCoral’s operations are driven by three core strategic pillars:

                    A. Ecological Restoration
                    The organization utilizes evidence-based methods for reef rehabilitation. Key activities include:

                    Artificial Reef Deployment: Engineering and deploying structures to stabilize the seabed and support
                    coral polyps.

                    Coral Propagation: collecting and replanting broken coral fragments to accelerate reef regeneration.

                    Biological Monitoring: Conducting regular data collection on marine life density and water quality
                    in collaboration with the Department of Fisheries Malaysia.

                    B. Community Empowerment (The "Community Diver" Initiative)
                    Sustainability requires local stewardship. MyCoral actively engages the coastal communities of
                    Terengganu, transforming local fishermen and villagers into certified ecosystem guardians. By
                    providing scuba diving certification and eco-tourism training, the program creates alternative
                    economic opportunities that incentivize conservation over exploitation.

                    C. Technological Innovation
                    To bridge the gap between the ocean and the general public, MyCoral leverages technology for
                    advocacy. The development of the MyCoral VR (Virtual Reality) module allows the public to experience
                    reef ecosystems immersively, fostering environmental awareness without the logistical barriers of
                    physical diving.

                    4. Recent Developments
                    As of late 2025, MyCoral has been integrated as a foundational component of the newly launched MSU
                    Centre for Climate Resilience and Strategy (m-CREST). This strategic elevation underscores the
                    university's commitment to climate action, providing the project with enhanced resources to expand
                    its footprint across the ASEAN region, including recent collaborative expansions into Indonesia.
